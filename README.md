# Multi-Container-NodeJS

Having two containers communicate (NodeJS and Redis Server) with docker.

## DISCLAIMER

At the time of making this, I have little to no experience with JS and NodeJS.

## Running

To run the two docker containers run the following command when in directory:

`docker-compose up`

## Stopping

To stop the two running docker containers with docker compose run the following command when in the current working directory:

`docker-compose down`
